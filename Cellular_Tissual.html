					The Cardiac Muscle Tissue only exists in the heart. The cells that form the muscle tissue are connected through branching, which allows each cell to have connections with other neighboring cells. The ends of the cell are lined with intercalated discs, that contain gap junctions for intercellular communication, and desmosomes for maintaining strong intercellular connection.<br>
					Desmosomes are necessary for keeping the cells connected when the whole muscle contracts. The contraction of cells occurs with every heartbeat. To contract, specific muscle cells called pacemaker cells signal the other cells to do so through gap junctions. When all cells act upon the signal in unison, the muscle contracts, and desmosomes ensure that the cells do not break apart during this movement. <br>
					The cardiac muscle contracts independently from the nervous system, although depending on the body's state, signals and hormones may influence the pacemaker cells.
